    <string name="info_me">I am currently at the University of Manchester studying Computer Science. I work on this in my spare time, which I don\'t end up with a lot of. I will do my best to keep it as up to date as possible and fix any bugs. Just leave me a comment on the store or email me (email listed on Play Store) and I\'ll sort any issues out ASAP! Also, feel free to leave any ideas you have for my app!</string>
